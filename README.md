# FRAUD_DETECTION
This code is for credit card fraud detection using logistic regression. 
The dataset used in this code is highly unbalanced, which means that there are very few fraudulent transactions compared to normal transactions. Therefore, under-sampling is performed to create a new balanced dataset. 
The new dataset is then split into features and targets and then into training and testing data.
A logistic regression model is trained on the training data, and its accuracy is evaluated on both training and testing data. 
Finally, a bar plot is used to compare the accuracy scores of the model on training and testing data.
